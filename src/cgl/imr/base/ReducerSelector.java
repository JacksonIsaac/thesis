 * This class and its specific implementation are used to group the outputs of
 * the Map task to the Reduce task queues. In a typical MapReduce computation,
 * all Map tasks can produce some result that maps to a particular Reduce task.
 * So normally all the Map tasks have some output to go into all the Reduce
 * tasks. This behavior can be change by extending this abstract class.
